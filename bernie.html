													<h3>Who is Bernie Sanders?</h3>
												</header>
												<h4> <strong>Author: Tiffany Yu </strong></h4>

												<p>Nearly everyone in this day and age has probably heard of Hillary Clinton, but what about the other old grandpa?</p>

												<p>As the elections are right around the corner, many who follow American politics will know that the democratic side is heating up intensely as the remaining two democrats have been head to head in the primaries. Many young millennials have been all over Bernie Sanders, but many people still don’t know who he is and what he stands for. Here are a few things you should know about Bernie Sanders.</p>

											<h4> <u><strong>General Background</strong></u></h4>
												<p>Bernard Sanders - more commonly known as Bernie Sanders - was born into a low income family on September 8, 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. With a burning passion to bring justice and support to American people, he studied Political Science in the University of Chicago and got involved with the anti-Vietnam War movement, racial equality demonstrations, socialist parties and much more. Bernie Sanders gained recognition for opposing President George W. Bush and the Iraq war, as well as defunding social welfare programs due to tax cuts for the rich. In 2006, he was elected as the Senator for Vermont, and later on in 2015, he announced his campaign for President of the United States.</p>

												<h4> <u><strong>Campaign and Funding</strong></u></h4>
												<p>What makes Sanders’ campaign so special? It runs on small donations (average of USD$29) and, unlike most politicians, it does not have a Super PAC (Political Action Committee that raises money from corporations, unions and individuals) that is funded mostly by large corporations. Politicians with Super PACs will have an incentive to make policies that benefit their donors. For example, Ted Cruz, who receives USD$887,450 from corporations in the Oil and Gas industry, has described global warming as a “pseudo-scientific theory because it can never, ever, ever be disproven.”, and has also said that “if it gets hotter or colder, wetter or drier — the climate has always changed since the beginning of time.”. The fact that many individuals and normal people (instead of large companies) donate small sums of money to Sanders’ campaign, reflect how many people are genuinely supportive of his views and that he really resonates with the average democratic American citizen. He also does not accept money from anyone who contradicts what he stands for e.g. Martin Shkreli (Pharma Bro). This shows how he does not waver under the influence of corruption and bribery, and that he sticks to his personal core values which shine through his policy ideas and position on socialistic views. </p>

												<h4> <u><strong>Policy and Position</strong></u></h4>
												<p>Throughout his campaign, Bernie Sanders’ has expressed his views on many issues, some of which really differentiates him from other candidates. Here are some of his main ideas.</p>
												<ol>
												<li><strong>1. Democratic Socialism</strong> - In America, where the word socialism has negative connotations to Marxist belief, dictatorship, abolishment of capitalism, and is usually mistaken as extreme socialism, Sanders’ boldly and confidently identifies himself as a democratic socialist. He describes a democratic socialist as someone who advocates many ways of social reform eg. “the minimum wage, unemployment insurance, job programs” that will simultaneously help the needy and allow the free market to develop within reasonable boundaries. “Democratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy” quotes Bernie Sanders.</li>
												<br>
												<li><strong>2. Wall Street Reform and Regulation</strong> - “It is time to break up the largest financial institutions in the country” - Bernie Sanders on reforming Wall Street. Sanders’ has discussed the issue of how the middle-class US taxpayers bailed out Wall Street during the financial crash of 2008, and barely got anything in return. He stands against the irresponsible and risky behaviour of Wall Street banks and plans to put strict regulations in place, eg. reinstating the Glass Steagall, to prevent another economic crisis and bring justice to the hardworking middle-class. This is an issue where Hillary Clinton flip-flops and contradicts herself. Wall Street institutions, such as Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, have contributed millions of dollars to her Super PAC and yet she claims that she will be the one to place strict regulations on Wall Street (keeping in mind that large institutions do not heavily invest in something to expect no returns.)</li>
												<br>

												<li><strong>3. Get Money Out of Politics!</strong> - Bernie Sanders is the only candidate in the race who doesn’t rely on large corporations and Super PACs to run their campaigns. The rest of the candidates who do so have the incentive to “pay back” their large donors with tax breaks, loose regulation etc., and may not act in the interest of the people. This allows rich corporations to influence and corrupt the political system. Bernie sanders plans to eliminate the ability for them to do so, by regulating money in politics and prevent too much money flowing in from the wealthy.</li>
												</ol>

												<h4> <u><strong>Where does he stand now?</strong></u></h4>
												<p>Currently he is tailing Hillary Clinton, his only opponent on the democratic side, winning states New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Colorado, Minnesota and Vermont. For some of these states, he has overcome as much as 60% deficits. Although Sanders’ has won a few states, he falls behind in delegates and superdelegates. Many mass media outlets have said that there is no hope for Bernie Sanders, but I believe that there is still a chance of him winning the democratic ticket and competing against the chosen Republican candidate in the general election. The question is can he make it in time? Will the democratic socialist revolution be able to pull him towards the finish line before Clinton and her Super PAC reaches it? </p>

												<h4> <u><strong>My conclusion</strong></u></h4>
												<p>If I were an eighteen year old American citizen, my vote would definitely go to Bernie Sanders (as you can probably tell by now). He has shown me the true meaning of being a politician, by striving, against all odds, to make a difference and fight for the society. I have so much respect for his passion and integrity, and progressive views. I truly believe that he deserves to be the one to lead the country. Even if he doesn’t win the election, the revolution and his ideas will live on. In the big picture, Bernie Sanders is only a small part of a large formula that aims to liberate the world. His true power lies in uniting his people as a collective power to achieve the goal of making the world a better place for all.</p>
