													<h3>Why Chris Rock's Asian Joke Is So Controversial - What Equality and Racism Really Entail</h3>
												</header>
												<h4> <strong>Author: Christie Gan </strong></h4>

												<p>This year’s Oscars 2016 ceremony was an absolute blast, especially considering the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio has finally won one. The only downside to this is there will be a considerable reduced number of relatable DiCaprio memes out there for our enjoyment. There is no denying that an Oscar was a well-deserved award for the over-nominated actor, having had to amaze and impress a vast audience an uncountable number of times before finally scoring this pleasant home run after five nominations (within the extremely long period of 22 years).</p>

												<p>Despite the fact that other wonderful events such as Alejandro Inarritu winning best director for The Revenant (also much to DiCaprio’s delight), Brie Larson winning best actress for Room and the appearances of part of the Star Wars cast, including Daisy Ridley, C-3PO, R2-D2 and BB-8, took place that night, the renowned ceremony had its cringeworthy moments. You know when you’re running late for work and you’re at a crossroads, know you have to turn right, but turn left instead? What happened during the Oscars is similar, but much, much worse.</p>

												<p>The host of the Oscars 2016, Chris Rock, has always been the epitome of a good role model when it came to bringing attention to the issue of there being predominantly white nominees. In most cases, the Black American ‘comedian’ was praised for the way he advocated for the inclusion more black nominees. Nobody considered Rock rewriting his Oscars script to address the issue of #OscarsSoWhite to be problematic. He has been praised for addressing #OscarsSoWhite in his opening monologue for the Oscars by rightly pointing out the unnecessary day-to-day discrimination that black people have to face, which white people are typically oblivious to.</p>

												<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love how people keep saying Chris Rock talked too much about being black. Was he supposed to talk about being white? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/peoplearesostooopid?src=hash">#peoplearesostooopid</a></p>&mdash; Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) <a href="https://twitter.com/chelseahandler/status/704487617954340865">March 1, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

												<p>The #OscarsSoWhite hashtag was allegedly launched by editor April Reign after last year’s Oscars nominees were publicised. It is a known fact that there is an unfair bias in Oscar nominees since they are mostly white (given that a large portion of the annual attendees are white actors). It is also a known fact that the vast majority of the audience at the Oscars has always been white. It was no different this year. Earlier this year, Reign tweeted:

												<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s actually worse than last year. Best Documentary and Best Original Screenplay. That&#39;s it. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OscarsSoWhite?src=hash">#OscarsSoWhite</a></p>&mdash; ☔️ April ☔️ (@ReignOfApril) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReignOfApril/status/687631786298486784">January 14, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
												<p>However, he clearly didn’t hold back when he decided it would be ‘funny’ to incorporate cheap racial humour by bringing three unknowing Asian children on stage with no lines whatsoever, calling them the “most hard-working representatives” of PricewaterhouseCoopers, apparently for the purpose of poking at the stereotype that Asians are “good at math”. Well, it did much more than just that. I most certainly agree that Rock took the idea that Asian kids are either accountants, or, disgustingly, child labourers, too far.</p>

												<p>Essentially, what this year’s charming Oscars host has done is allegedly be in full agreement with the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, but only speak up about excluding black nominees, then proceed to make a racial joke about Asians. To my personal knowledge, excluding the white race, black isn’t the only other minority race that exists. What about the Asians? The Hispanics? Surely the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite is about them too? He’s either been hiding under a rock (no pun intended) or doesn’t appear to be very informed about the fact that this whole controversy is not just about giving a voice to excelling black actors and actresses who have yet to be nominated. The #BlackLivesMatter controversy may be all about giving a voice to oppressed black people, which is completely fine, nevertheless, #OscarsSoWhite concerns not only blacks, but also the remaining minority races.</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

												<p>Additionally, racial humour does nothing to help empower the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. In fact, it’s the opposite of making things better for people of colour (abbreviated as PoC), which, if Rock hasn’t noticed, does include black people, too. Rock’s stereotypical joke was not humourous. It was not something to be taken lightheartedly. It was an offensive, unnecessary, unfunny joke that, needless to say, needs to be apologised for and ‘taken back’. Iconic Asian figures such as actress Arden Cho and professional basketball player Jeremy Lin have expressed their thoughts about the issue:</p>

<p> The frustration expressed by Cho and Lin in regards to Rock’s big mistake serves as a reminder that there are holes in our education system. We are taught about what morals are in school, but we aren’t taught extensively about racism. We aren’t taught terms such as ‘people of colour’, nor are we properly taught what ‘equality’ really means. A prime example of a hugely controversial topic is feminism. Upon hearing the word ‘feminism’, men automatically assume that it means ‘women are greater than men’, when in reality, it means ‘women are equal to men’. Unfortunately, even women have trouble understanding the point of feminism and the definition of ‘equality’. </p>

<p> Why, you ask? May I suggest that it has something to do with the way we teach our children, the beliefs we enforce upon them from childhood?</p>


												<p>Just last October, a mother by the name of Rusty Styles received a text message from her son: a picture of publishing company McGraw-Hill Education’s latest world geography textbook, captioned with “we was real hard workers wasn’t we [Unamused face emoji]”. The picture contained a statement that read, “The Atlantic Slave Trade between the 1500s and 1800s brought millions of workers from Africa to the Southern United States to work on agricultural plantations.” </p>

												<img src ="http://3p3mq242g5jc2ki76r3wi6fq.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/slavetrade.jpg">
												<p><strong>Styles’ son’s text message to her, using phrasing common to uneducated slaves at the time that the “Atlantic Slave Trade” occurred.</strong></p>

												<p>The problem is, it’s clear that McGraw-Hill referred to African victims of the U.S. slave trade as “workers”, implying that the African victims had been awarded this “job”. Now, correct me if I’m wrong, but does a slave trade not mean that the African victims had been forced into slave labour? Slave trade is no joke. The term “Slave Trade” connotes unnecessary torture and separation of millions of innocent, unlucky, choiceless families. In a video that Styles made clarifying enquiries about the book and its publisher, it was evident that the book had been reviewed by over 20+ academics before it was even published. </p>

												<p>How was it possible that so many of them had reviewed the book and none of them had noticed the significant error that was made? Simply, these professionals either weren’t properly taught the definition of “Slave Trade”, or are inherently racist.</p>

												<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwOethzt5mg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
												<p><strong>Styles explains the snippet of racism in McGraw-Hill’s world geography textbook</strong></p>

												<p>In short, we cannot completely blame Chris Rock for the unsettling racist joke he made during the ceremony. Rock was born and grew up in the U.S., the same continent in which McGraw-Hill (whose headquarters lie in New York) is in. Named one of the “big three” educational local and international publishers, McGraw-Hill may have potentially influenced not one, not two, but possibly even thousands and millions of children across the continent, and even the world. </p>

												<p>This is why change is compulsory. Rock may have moved one step forward for speaking up about the lack of black nominees throughout the 88 years that the Oscars has been running for, but he set everyone an infinite number of steps back by crossing a line that was never meant to be crossed. It is important that all minorities stand up and do whatever they can to make themselves heard, and it is even more important that the majority remain open minded and good listeners, exactly like the way we’ve always been taught to behave regardless of the schools we’ve been to in different countries and continents. Together with our fellow celebrities whose voices aren’t as oppressed as ours, we can build an appropriate understanding of what equality means and how we should achieve this.</p>

												<p>Change cannot wait.</p>
