													<h3>Guantanamo in a Prisoner’s Eyes and the Oppression of the Mass Media</h3>
												</header>
												<h4> <strong>Author: Tiffany Yu </strong></h4>
												<p>One Sunday afternoon, I had been scrolling on facebook and (after many cute animal videos) I came across this article on Guantanamo Bay. It was on the recent hunger strikes, and President Obama’s controversial decision to shut it down. It took me by surprise that these prisoners have actively protested for so many years, and at such a degree, so I decided to do more research into the issue. And as I digged deeper into it, larger systemic problems, regarding the reliability of the mass media, gradually started to uncover before me...</p>
												<p>On the coast of Guantanamo Bay, Southeast Cuba, lies a structure of grey, concrete slabs surrounded by barbed wire fence - Guantanamo Bay detention camp. U.S. authorities set up the institution in 2002, for the purpose of detaining suspected terrorists who were connected to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Guantanamo Bay (detention camp) - otherwise known as Gitmo, GTMO or G-bay - soon became an important site that held alleged members of al-Qaeda (the fundamentalist, Islamic terrorist organisation who organised 9-11, and was lead by Osama bin Laden) as well as alleged fighters for the Taliban (Islamic fundamentalist movement). However, Obama has recently proposed to close the facility, and relocate some of the remaining 91 detainees to institutions in the US. This has sparked controversy as many US citizens do not feel safe with the decision to let suspected terrorists enter US grounds.</p>
												<p><video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIWKNcKtEH8"></video></p>
												<p>In the twenty first century, media coverage on Guantanamo Bay has shed light on the horrific and extremely unethical methods of torture (also referred to as “enhanced interrogation” by the U.S Government) as well as the severe hunger strikes and protests led by the detainees. Someone who has been informed about the subject through the mass media could could easily enlighten you on the situation in Guantanamo Bay, but the question is - were the American authorities and mass media representatives able to relay the whole truth?</p>
												<p><strong>“Guantanamo is being open under one concept, how to destroy a human being.” - Shaker Aamer, former prisoner of Guantanamo Bay detention camp.</strong></p>
												<p>By listening to interviews of past detainees, you can easily tell that this is not the case. The American establishment media has planted this idea into our heads that Guantanamo Bay only incarcerates the deadliest, most terrorising, immoral and radical monsters, who are a threat to the safety of the USA - as if it is only right that these people are confined and tortured for the sins the have committed.</p>
												<p>Shaker Aamer, who was detained for 14 years in Guantanamo Bay, has made his case to many news stations including BBC, and is one of the small fraction of anti-Guantanamo activists, who has real life experience as a prisoner. He travelled to Jalalabad, Afghanistan, (ironically) to do volunteer work, but he was mistakenly captured and brought to Guantanamo Bay as a suspected terrorist who had relations to Osama bin Laden. He was able to reunite with his family in the UK and be freed from the horrible living conditions of the detention camp after receiving a lot of help from a number of different sources, such as his lawyer, Amnesty and British Government authorities. </p>
												<p>In an interview with RT, he expressed his strong views against the media’s representation of Guantanamo, as they focus too much on the hunger strikes and how prisoners are too dangerous to be released, effectively “diverting the audience” to the real issue of the dehumanisation and complete disregard of their human rights. </p>
												<p>Aamer states that the U.S. authorities are reluctant to release detainees, regardless of the fact that they are imprisoned without trial - the reason being: “it will show the failure of the [US] intelligence service, the CIA, and all the other services... that they couldn’t prove that these brothers did anything wrong.”  He then states that a staggering “98% of people” are allegedly innocent and have nothing to do with the conflict in Iraq or Afghanistan. If what Aamer says is true, is everything the media said, about the hostile and dangerous terrorists, a lie?</p>
												<p><strong>“When I saw everybody in guantanamo, I was like laughing because there were guys from South Africa, from Gambia, from Somalia, from Bosnia, from all over the world. These guys they got nothing to do with Afghanistan and the war against the Americans.” - Shaker Aamer</strong></p>
												<p>Yes, the issue of innocent people being tortured and imprisoned without trial is a huge problem, but I believe that the case of Guantanamo Bay raises an even greater issue - the silencing of victims by the mass media. As we can see, sometimes it may not be the interest of media outlets to broadcast certain stories - the story may not appeal to their target audience, the organisations/government who fund the outlet may not want some information to be released in the public, or the issue may be too controversial and could potentially garner criticism from viewers. To hide certain things from the public, instead of leaving the story unaired, newscasters can communicate information in a misleading way or steer the focus away from the main issue. As a result, the information shown to the public, may not always be the full truth. </p>
												<p>In essence, the purpose of this article is to shed light on the flaws of the US Justice, Information and Military systems, but also to give a wake up call to people who believe every word that comes out of a reporter's mouth. We must understand that media companies have their own motives, and at times it may not overlap with the core values of honest journalism. There may also be times when journalists make mistakes in their reporting, or when news companies have insufficient information and too little perspectives on the issue. Subsequently, this may cause information to be distorted or under/overplayed. My main message to you is to always be skeptical of what is being said in the news; even the most acclaimed sources will have their grey areas. </p>
